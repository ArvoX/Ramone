\chapter{Getting started}

\section{The very first GET of a ressource}

The simplest possible operation we can do with Ramone is a GET of a resource 
from a well known URL and then decode that resource into a client side object.

As an example we can GET the Twitter timeline for user JornWildt:

\lstset{style=sharpc}
\begin{lstlisting}
      // All interaction with Ramone goes through a session
      ISession session
        = RamoneConfiguration.NewSession(new Uri("https://api.twitter.com"));

      // Fixed URL to timeline of JornWildt
      string url = "/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=JornWildt";

      // Create a Ramone request by binding variables to a URI template
      Request request = session.Bind(url);

      // GET response from Twitter
      Response response = request.Get();

      // Extract payload as a C# dynamic created from the JSON response
      dynamic timeline = response.Body;

      // Write response to console ...
      Console.WriteLine("This is the timeline for JornWildt:");
      foreach (dynamic tweet in timeline)
        Console.WriteLine("* {0}.", tweet.text);
\end{lstlisting}




\section{Universal Resource Identifiers}

Ramone depends on System.Uri for resource identification and adds no additional semantics to them.


\section{URI Templates}

Ramone depends on System.UriTemplate for URI templates.
