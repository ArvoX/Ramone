Ramone is a C\# client side library that simplifies access to HTTP based Web APIs 
and REST services. It has a strong focus on REST and implements elements of the 
Uniform Interface as first class citizens of the API.

This means natural support for

\begin{itemize}

\item URIs as identifiers for resources.
\item The standard HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and more.
\item Multiple media types (XML, JSON, HTML, ATOM and more).
\item User defined media types.
\item Hyper media controls (linking and key/value forms).

\end{itemize}

What Ramone does is to wrap the inner workings of HTTP (using .NET's 
HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse classes) and make encoding and decoding easier 
through the use of codecs for the various formats used on the web.

Ramone supports plain XML, JSON, and Atom out of the box, but where it really
excels is when it comes to working with user defined objects, domain specific
media types and hyper media elements.
